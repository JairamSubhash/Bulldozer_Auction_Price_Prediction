# Bulldozer_Auction_Price_Prediction


In this project, we predicted bulldozer prices using machine learning techniques. With a dataset containing over 52 features and 400,000 data points, we achieved an RMSLE score of 0.257 on the validation set, placing 29th on the Kaggle leaderboard. By preprocessing and cleaning the data and employing cross-validation, we enhanced the predictive accuracy of our model.

Key Features:

Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning.

Employed cross-validation to discover optimal hyperparameters.

Leveraged Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebooks.
